### About

Stackchain is a free open source crypto communication platform for investors

### Concept
<p>Allow all users to create stacks (grouping of cryptoassets) and share them. Users submit stacks with tokens availables via CoinMarketCap API then communicate with other users about their choices in order to improve or modify their stacks.</p>

Stackchain was a school project that I've since abandoned for new application development, so it's not available.
